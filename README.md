# Pokemon Battle Simulator
A Pokemon Battle engine coded in Java. Has local and multiplayer options (multiplayer not perfect), only runs from command line.

## Features

### Local:
Simulator can be run locally against the computer. Opponent chooses moves randomly, with a provided team loaded from a .txt file.

### Multiplayer:
Multiplayer only works from LAN, as peer-to-peer; one player acts as the client, another as the server. Currently, fails at transferring team across sockets.

### Team Loading from Text: 
Loads Pokemon team from .txt files. Uses the traditional formatting Pokemon Online and Pokemon Showdown uses. Allows for custom Pokemon team options, can create a team in Showdown, save to .txt, and place in appropriate directory.

## Future Implementation
* Get multiplayer to work
* Add online functionality to LAN multiplayer
* Refactor code (not always very clean)
* Merge with Pokemon Emerald Bootleg to form working engine
